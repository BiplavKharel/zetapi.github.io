# Zeta Pi Website

This is the Zeta Pi Official Website!

We started our building out website in June 2023 and deployed it by utilizing Vercel.

index.html is the home page of the website.

The rush-archive.html file contains code for the alternate view of the Rush tab on the website. 
For example, during the majority of the semester rush.html will have the code to display "come back next semester"
and rush-archive.html will have the rush calendar code, which will not be displayed on the website.
Please retain this.
