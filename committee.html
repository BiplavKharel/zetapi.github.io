            <h3>Academic Development</h3>
            <p> The Academic Development Committee aims to support brothers in their
                studies. This committee holds a cram night event every other week, where any
                brother can come study or do work together, plus enjoy snacks. The other two
                events held each month are technical advancement themed, such as
                hackathons, design jams, LeetCode grind sessions, and introductory tech
                workshops. This committee also provides services to brothers such as making
                study groups, a knowledge base of classes, and partner matching for EECS
                classes.

            <h3>Ethics</h3>
            <p> The ethics committee meets every week to have conversations about the ethical and moral
                implications surrounding various fields of technology. These discussions are just for fun 
                and aim to expand the mindset of our brothers while also preparing them for a future of 
                responsibly working with technology.

                <h3>Fundraising</h3>
                <p>Since Zeta Pi is meant to be inclusive for everyone, our dues are very low. Because of
                    this, we must get funding for our events through other means.
                    Insert the fundraising committee! Members hold a fundraiser every two weeks, selling
                    things like food, stickers and pins. The other two meetings each month are spent
                    planning the next fundraiser.

                <h3>Marketing</h3>
                <p>The Marketing Committee focuses on the design aspect of Zeta Pi.
                    Some responsibilities of members of this committee involve running
                    the social media, designing merch, creating advertising material for
                    rush, and anything else that involves an artistic touch.

                <h3>Professional Development</h3>
                <p>The Professional Development committee hosts events that aim to aid
                    brothers in advancing their careers and professional skills. Some events that
                    are hosted by this committee include mock interviews, resume workshops,
                    lightning talks, and professional headshots. This committee hosts two events
                    a month, with the other two meetings being used for planning the next event.

                <h3>Recruitment & Membership</h3>
                <p> As the name implies, the Recruitment and Membership committee handles
                    rushing, pledging, and retaining membership in the frat. Although any
                    brother can choose to attend rush events, and all are required to participate
                    in inducting the pledges each semester, the members of this committee will
                    be in charge of organizing and hosting these events. Members are also
                    responsible for tracking the participation of current brothers, as each
                    brother is required to attend at least 10 events or meetings every semester in
                    order to retain their standing as a brother. Because of the elevated
                    responsibilities of this committee, it is the only one that has two heads.

                <h3>Social</h3>
                <p>The Social Committee organizes all of Zeta Pi's fun, non-academic or
                    professional events. There is a social event put on that all brothers are
                    welcome to attend every two weeks. The other two monthly meeting consist of
                    planning the events, which are intended for the members of the committee.
                    Some typical events hosted by the social committee are date parties, big/little
                    events, game nights, IM sports and seasonal activities such as pumpkin carving and
                    snowball fights.
