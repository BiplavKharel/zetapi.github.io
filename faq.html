        <h3>How do I join?</h3>
        <p> We recruit new members at the beginning of fall and winter semester.
          We require that you have atleast three semesters left at the university,
          otherwise everyone is welcome to apply! For rush dates and more details,
          see the <a href="rush.html" class="hvr-sweep-to-right">rush</a> section.

    <section class="question">
      <div class="question-text">
        <h3>How is a tech frat different from a social frat?</h3>
        <p> The difference between professional frats and social frats typically is
          the focus on professional development as well as the absence of a shared
          living space. In other words, unlike your typical frat or sorority on
          campus, Brothers in Zeta Pi are not required to live together in a house.
          Although there is a strong emphasis of community and brotherhood in Zeta
          Pi, membership aims to aid you in your professional and academic career
          instead of potentially distracting from it. Most events are completely
          optional and only exist for the benefit of the brothers.

    <section class="question">
      <div class="question-text">
        <h3>How do I join a committee?</h3>
        <p> Any brother can join a committee at any time during the semester! Elections
          for committee heads are held every year before winter break. Unfortunately,
          pledges are not allowed to join a committee or run for a committee head
          position until they are initiated as a brother.</p>

    <section class="question">
      <div class="question-text">
        <h3>What is a big/little mentorship?</h3>
        <p> Big/little mentorship pairs less experienced "littles" with more
          experienced, older "bigs" that act as mentors to help guide brothers
          both professionally and academically. Bigs act as a safety net for their
          littles and help them assimilate into the frat after their initiation.
          Big/little reveals take place after pledge initiation each semester, and
          are based on the connections made between pledges and brothers during the
          pledging process.

    <section class="question">
      <div class="question-text">
        <h3>How much of a time commitment is being a brother?</h3>
        <p> The answer to this question entirely depends on you! Any member of the
          Exec Board must attend two meetings a week, so the time commitment is fairly
          high. Members of other committees are highly encouraged to attend their weekly
          committee meeting, and brothers who are not members of any committee are not
          required to attend any meetings. This being said, every brother must attend at
          least 10 events or meetings a semester to retain standing, so the baseline time
          commitment is about an hour a week.
