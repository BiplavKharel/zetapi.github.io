        <h3>What is "rush"?</h3>
        <p> Rush represents a recruitment phase within fraternities, including professional chapters. During this
          time, the fraternity actively seeks new members and organizes events for potential recruits to gain
          insight into the fraternity's objectives and engagements. For professional fraternities, these occasions
          often comprise networking sessions, workshops, and social gatherings, facilitating a mutual assessment
          of compatibility. Following the Rush period, invitations are extended to individuals whose values align
          with those of the fraternity.
